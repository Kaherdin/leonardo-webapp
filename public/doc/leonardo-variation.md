Sample Request

curl --request GET \
 --url https://cloud.leonardo.ai/api/rest/v1//variations/universal-upscaler \
 --header 'accept: application/json' \
 --header 'authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>'

{
"ultraUpscaleStyle": "ARTISTIC",
"creativityStrength": 5,
"detailContrast": 5,
"similarity": 5
"upscaleMultiplier": 2,
"generatedImageId": "<YOUR_GENERATED_IMAGE_ID>",
}
Note: To retrieve the image URL, run the Get Variation ID endpoint after this step or receive the image URL via webhook callback.

Parameters
ultraUpscaleStyle - Choose between Artistic and Realistic. This will greatly affect the result. It is highly recommended to use Artistic when using Ultra with 2D style imagery.
creativityStrength - Determines how much creative deviation occurs when adding additional detail to the image. Note that higher strengths will greatly change the image from the original.
upscaleMultiplier - Determines how large the image will be upscaled to.
detailContrast: Similar to the HDR options on other upscale services, this affects the contrast levels of details within the image. This effect can be very pronounced on the edges of objects and may look unrealistic if set to extremely high levels. (Similar to an extreme Unsharp Mask effect in Photoshop or Structure / Sharpness in photo editors.)
similarity - This determines how far the overall image structure will retain similarity or diverge from the original. Useful when using with Creativity Strength to preserve some semblance of the original image.

Tip

Set creativityStrength, detailContrast, and similarity to 5 as the starting point and adjust accordingly depending on your desired results.
The maximum upscaled image size is 20MP.
Cost

Tip

The parametercreativityStrength refers to how 'creative' the AI will be on the original image. The higher it is, the more details will be applied.
The upscaleMultiplier must be between 1 and 2. The bigger the value, the higher the resolution.
The maximum upscaled image size is 20MP.
Sample Request

curl --request GET \

{
"upscalerStyle": "CINEMATIC",
"creativityStrength": 8,
"upscaleMultiplier": 2,
"generatedImageId": "<YOUR_GENERATED_IMAGE_ID>",
}
Ensure that you run the Get Variation ID endpoint to retrieve the image URL after this step
