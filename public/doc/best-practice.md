Guide to the Webhook Callback Feature
Generating images will take a few seconds to complete. Instead of polling the Get a Single Generation API endpoint, it's more efficient to receive a message containing the links to your images and other metadata. To receive a message, you need to leverage the webhook callback feature.

Setting the Webhook Callback
When creating a production API key, you have the option to fill in your webhook callback URL and webhook callback API key.

Webhook URL and webhook API key is set during production API key creation.

üìò
Note

The webhook callback URL and webhook callback API key are not required for creating an API key.
The webhook callback URL field requires HTTPS.
The webhook callback API key will be used for authenticating to your webhook callback. It will be added to the header of the request asauthorization: Bearer $yourWebhookCallbackApiKey.
To update your webhook callback URL and webhook callback API key, you need to create a new production API key with the new webhook details, then delete the old one after switching to the new API key.
Examining Leonardo's Request to your Webhook
Many users find it useful to first study Leonardo's requests to their webhook using online tools like Webhook.site. Using such tools, you can analyse:

Which host and where in the world will the request come from so you can allow those requests?
What headers is Leonardo sending so you can make sure that your web servers, firewall, security tool, etc. do not block the requests?
Is your webhook callback API key being passed correctly?

Not receiving messages in your webhook from Leonardo?

Note that the webhook callback API key will be added to the header of the request as authorization: Bearer $yourWebhookCallbackApiKey. Please make sure that your system expects that header.
Please check your system for anything that disallow traffic by IP address, location, headers, etc.
Please check if your SSL Certificate is configured correctly. For example, run openssl s_client -showcerts -connect YOUR_DOMAIN:443 -servername YOUR_DOMAIN to check if your server's certificate and intermediate certificates are properly set.
Sample Request to your Webhook
Below is a sample request made by Leonardo to a webhook callback.

curl -X 'POST' \
 'https://webhook.site/cc21af5f-4caa-498e-8f26-20c664680b73' \
 -H 'connection: close' \
 -H 'host: webhook.site' \
 -H 'accept-encoding: gzip, compress, deflate, br' \
 -H 'content-length: 3166' \
 -H 'user-agent: axios/1.4.0' \
 -H 'authorization: Bearer abcd' \
 -H 'content-type: application/json' \
 -H 'accept: application/json, text/plain, _/_' \

Guide to Handling Not Safe for Work Image Generation (NSFW)
Choosing a Finetuned Model
Leonardo.Ai continuously improves safeguards against NSFW generations. Newer Platform Models will tend to be less susceptive to NSFW generation.

Stable Diffusion v1.5 (SD1.5) and Platform Models based on SD1.5 are known to be prone to generate NSFW. As such, we use a more conservative detection and flagging mechanism for these family of models. The best practice is to use newer models such as those based on Stable Diffusion SDXL.0_9, Stable Diffusion SDXL.1_0, and SDXL.LIGHTNING (SDXL).

To check the base model of a Platform Model, navigate to Finetuned Models and switch to platform Platform Models tab. Click on the model and then click on View More.

Checking the base model of a Platform Model
Checking the base model of a Platform Model

You can also refer to the table here to check the base model of a particular finetuned model.

üìò
Note on PhotoReal

PhotoReal v1 is a workflow based on SD1.5 thus prone to generate NSFW. The best practice is to use the latest version, PhotoReal v2, which uses SDXL.

Blocking at the Prompt Level
Like the Leonardo web app, the Leonardo API will block NSFW image generation by default. Any prompts flagged as NSFW will return a 400 Bad Request error.

For example, generating with a prompt ‚Äúnude‚Äù will be blocked with the following error:

{  
 "error": "content moderation filter: nude",  
 "path": "$",  
 "code": "unexpected"  
}
Flagging at the Response Level
The Production API returns a NSFW attribute that flags if the image generated contains NSFW material. Depending on your use case, you can opt to filter out the flagged images and not return them to your end users.

 },
...
]
...
If you‚Äôd like more rigid NSFW controls, please contact us for assistance, letting us know about your use case and requirements.

üìò
Note

Stable Diffusion v1.5 (SD1.5) and Platform Models based on SD1.5 are more prone to generate NSFW images. We recommend using SDXL based models for lower risk of NSFW images. Find out more about which Finetuned models use SDXL as base here.

Adding your own Image Moderation Layer
For use cases that require more control over the images generated, we recommend adding your own image moderation layer. You can implement your own system, leverage a more specialised third-party detection system, and/or keep a human in the loop to check against your guidelines.
